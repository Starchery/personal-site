# hi.

This is a simple blog based on
[practical typography](https://0x0.st/Njj5)
by Matthew Butterick.
I intend to use it to talk about programming,
but I might occasionally talk about music, among other things.


## how to use this site

<div class="aside">
    This site is a work-in-progress.
    Please
    <a href="mailto:randolph.henry.work@gmail.com">let me know</a>
    if you encounter any weirdness.
</div>

Links are set in [small caps](/).
Unlike [practical typography](https://0x0.st/Njj5),
both cross-references and external links are set this way.

The faux nav bar on the left is an exception:

1. everything in the nav bar is a link
2. `ydnar.dev` is a link to the home page
(the one youâ€™re on now)
