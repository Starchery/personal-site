title: hi, i’m randy.

This is a simple blog based on
[practical typography](https://0x0.st/Njj5)
by Matthew Butterick.
I intend to use it to talk about programming,
but I might occasionally talk about music, among other things.


## how to use this site

{{< aside >}}
This site is a work-in-progress.
Please
[let me know](mailto:randolph.henry.work@gmail.com)
if you encounter any weirdness.
{{< /aside >}}

Links are set in [small caps.](/)
Unlike [practical typography,](https://0x0.st/Njj5)
both cross-references and external links are set this way.

The faux nav bar is an exception:

1. everything in the nav bar is a link
2. `ydnar.dev` is a link to the home page
(the one you’re on now)
