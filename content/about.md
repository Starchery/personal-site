title: about
---

My name is Randy Henry.
My projects are visible on my
[github](github.com/Starchery)
while I go through the process of finishing up the
[projects](/projects)
section on here.

I’m most familiar with
[python](https://python.org),
but I’ve been spending time learning
[rust](https://rust-lang.org)
and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
also.

I like
sample-based rap,
indie {folk,rock,pop},
{neo-,}soul,
jazz{,-fusion},
reggae,
and chess&mdash;though I’m pretty bad at it.

## how to use this site

Links are set in [small caps.](/)
Unlike [practical typography,](https://0x0.st/Njj5)
both cross-references and external links are set this way.

The faux nav bar is an exception:

1. everything in the nav bar is a link
2. `ydnar.dev` is a link to the home page
(the one you’re on now)
